BadNewsResponses Website

When a friend gives you some bad news, one of the toughest choices you'll make is deciding which culturally-relevant phrase you'll use in response; examples, as of 2018, include "rip" or "oof." Thankfully, I made a website to decide for you.

(In reality, this website will only ever give you one response:
	"I'm sorry that's happened to you, is there any way I can help?"
The purpose of this website is to remind people to focus on their friends' problems, not on crafting the perfect response"
